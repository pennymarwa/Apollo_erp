# Apollo_erp

The goal of this project was to create an ERP system for SPS branch of Apollo hospital in India. The hospital demanded for a system to have record of all the patients, when added and discharged, which doctor's supervision etc. Apart from that they wanted an email system for feedback form of patients after discharge. Also, the feedback form gives an average output to the admin.

There is an admin panel which has the right to add patients or edit the portal. The user will only get a link to feedback form in the email where they can submit there response which goes to the admin.

The front-end was designed in core HTML, CSS. PHP was used as a programming language. Data Structure Array was used for saving the dymanic values from the form in the table created for storage. The database used was done in MySQL. 

The user interface was made responsive using Bootstrap. Adding JavaScript for validations, Ajax for asynchronous transporting data and Jquery for better interface added features to the Web Application. Fast and dynamic web pages were designed.

The project contains all tables of database in apollo DB which you have to MySQL with name apollo. The database has all the tables used in the project. Then make the suitable changes in the connection of database.

This code can help you with working of HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX and MySql.
